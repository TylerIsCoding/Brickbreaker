<p>This is a game that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the OOP paradigm.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</p>
<br>
<p>
I built this game with mainly JavaScript. It uses the canvas via the DOM to render the game in the browser.

- HTML5 provided the structure and content for the website
- CSS3 was used to style and layout the website
- JavaScript was used to create the entirety of the game's code, physics, and levels.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Here are some ways that I could increase performance on the game:

I could have:

- Changed the way that the game renders it's frames. Right now, faster computers run the game at a faster rate than slower computers.
- The code is pretty clean but could be improved.

This game was just a test for me to play with the 2D canvas via the DOM.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Building this game was a great learning experience and I took away several valuable lessons:

- The importance of the canvas element in the DOM.
- The importance of Object Oriented Programming.
- The importance of how each frame is rendered.
